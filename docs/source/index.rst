   contain the root `toctree` directive.

============
Introduction
============

Welcome to the ancillary tools (ANTS) documentation.  ANTS is a Python library
built on top of |Iris| that aims to help you produce ancillary files.

The ANTS library provides routines and tools that will help you when you want
to do any of the following:

1. Produce ancillary files on a new model domain.
2. Produce a new set of ancillaries from new source data.
3. Derive a completely new set of ancillary fields for a new parametrisation scheme.


---------------------
Contributions welcome
---------------------

ANTS development is ongoing as it supports new ancillary science implementations,
new datasets, and new domains. Your assistance in reporting
`bugs <https://github.com/MetOffice/ANTS/issues/new?template=bug-report.md>`_
and `documentation <https://github.com/MetOffice/ANTS/issues/new?template=documentation-request.md>`_
issues is gratefully received.  We're particularly keen to identify where the
documentation could be clearer - suggested improvements are not necessary but
are appreciated.  If you'd prefer not to open a ticket, you can also
